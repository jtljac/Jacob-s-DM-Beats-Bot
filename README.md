# Jacobs-DM-Beats-Bot
A simple discord bot setup for playing predefined sequences of songs on command, with many control features

This discord bot is designed as a music bot for DnD, it allows a DM to play songs in a voice call in response to commands, the bot has support for queuing sounds, looping infinitely or by a finite amount (per song), looping the queue of songs, seeking through the songs

Sound commands can be loaded via a JSON file, where they can be configured to play a sequence of songs, controlling how many times each song loops before moving onto the next one,
you can also set a command up so it picks a random song from a list each time.
